### Hi there üëã

I am engaged in Data Science and ML, currently undergoing advanced training at the Institute of Bioinformatics. I graduated from St. Petersburg State University with a degree in Biology (Biochemistry) and have four years of experience working with biochemical data (I am involved in omics science, in particular metabolomics). I am passionate about developing tools for efficient data analysis and automation of routine work.

## Skills
- Unix/bash (SAM-tools, bwa tools)
- Python (Variables and operations, classes and types, modules, virtualenv, pip, pipenv, pandas/numpy/biopython, Git / GitHub, regular expressions, exceptions, debugging, databases, data structures) - see [https://github.com/nerofeeva2001/Python_projects]
- Biostatistics and data visualization in R (ggplot2, readxl, dplyr, subset, apply, .Rmd)
