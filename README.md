### Hi there 👋

I am engaged in Data Science and ML, currently undergoing advanced training at the Institute of Bioinformatics. I graduated from St. Petersburg State University with a degree in Biology (Biochemistry) and have four years of experience working with biochemical data (I am involved in omics science, in particular metabolomics). I am passionate about developing tools for efficient data analysis and automation of routine work.

## Skills
- Unix/bash (SAM-tools, bwa tools)
- Python (Variables and operations, classes and types, modules, virtualenv, pip, pipenv, pandas/numpy/biopython, Git / GitHub, regular expressions, exceptions, debugging, databases, data structures) - see [My project](https://github.com/nerofeeva2001/Python_projects)
- Machine learning (Pandas, numpy, logical methods, methods of selection of optimal hyperparameters of the model, basics of clustering, Decision Trees, Random forest, gradient bousting, convolutional neural networks) - see [My project](https://github.com/nerofeeva2001/BI-ml-2024) and 
- Biostatistics and data visualization in R (ggplot2, readxl, dplyr, subset, apply, .Rmd) 
- Bioinformatics (metabolomic analysis (data acquisition, mass spectra identification, univariate and multivariate statistics); alignment to reference and SNP search, de novo genome assembly, and genome annotation)
